## Key Features

* Very Easy & Versatile Frontend Code
  - Instantly click live server on the index.html file inside and the web template will pop up.
* No logic Just Frontend Design
  - I did not add the logic because I want to allow room for your own custom code to be implemented to further your operation.
* Easy To Read Code 
* Commented Lines To Show You Where Everything Is
* Mobile Responsive As Well
* It Is As Simple As Downloading The Folder & Customizing Your Phishing / Rsearch Strategy
* Supports Multiple Browsers
* Netlify Upload Or To Your Own Custom Domain
* Most Recent Designs Or Well Known Ones
* Custom Coded It All From Scratch, I Did Not Use Clone Generators etc.
